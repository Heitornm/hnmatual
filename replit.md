# Portfolio Website - Heitor Martins

## Overview

This is a full-stack portfolio website for Heitor Martins, a Systems Development student. The application is built with a modern tech stack featuring React on the frontend, Express.js on the backend, and PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence. The website showcases Heitor's professional experience, education, skills, and provides a contact form for potential clients or employers.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client, server, and shared code:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, styled using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Shared**: Common TypeScript types and schemas shared between frontend and backend

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system using CSS variables
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library based on Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Theming**: Dark/light mode support with custom theme provider
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Development**: Hot reload with Vite middleware in development
- **Storage**: Abstract storage interface with in-memory implementation (ready for database integration)
- **API**: RESTful API structure with `/api` prefix

### Component Structure
The frontend is organized into logical sections:
- **Navigation**: Fixed header with smooth scrolling navigation
- **Hero Section**: Main landing area with call-to-action buttons
- **About Section**: Personal introduction and statistics
- **Experience Section**: Professional work history with expandable details
- **Education Section**: Academic background with semester breakdown
- **Skills Section**: Technical competencies organized by category
- **Contact Section**: Contact form and information
- **Footer**: Site navigation and social links

## Data Flow

1. **Client-Server Communication**: RESTful API calls using fetch with TanStack Query for caching and state management
2. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database queries with PostgreSQL
3. **Form Handling**: React Hook Form manages form state with client-side validation
4. **Theme Management**: Context-based theme provider with localStorage persistence
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS breakpoints
